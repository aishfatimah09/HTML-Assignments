                    <p>My Father is not just an inspiration to me but every people around us. In addition, to being a good father he is also a good husband, an obedient son, and for everyone else, he is a humble and polite man.
            
            Furthermore, he treats everyone equally and does not do any type of discrimination with anyone. He is famous in all our relatives and neighborhood and everyone talks highly about him as he helps everyone in need. Also, for advice also people seek him as he has a solution to every problem.
            
            Ready to Help Others
            As we have seen in the movies that the hero is very popular in his locality so do my father because he is ready to help everyone at any time. I remember a recent incident when one of his colleagues and friend fall ill and needed help then my father wholeheartedly supported him and his family. My father helped them in the most critical times when they needed help.
            
            In addition, he also arranged for finances for them. As at that time they are not financially stable and his colleagues are the only earning member of the family. Also, he spends an hour in the hospital to complete the formalities and arranging the medicine.
            
            Besides, my father many of his other colleagues also contributed money and other means to help the family of ill. After the complete recovery of the colleague he and his family visited our home and especially thanked my father for his efforts and help. After that incident whenever I think of that incident I feel proud of him. I learned this willingness to help others from him.
            Striking Balance in Life
            My father has other qualities too he also hard working and punctual and dedicated to his work and often work late hours. But for this, he never compromises his time with family. Besides, in the office and among our relatives everyone appreciates him for his hard work. 
            
            Also, during his college and school day is was among the top performer and won many awards. In his office often announced as the employee of the month. Besides, there were times when I have seen him working late at hours even on holidays. He knows how to maintain his professional and personal life and that’s the thing I love most about him.
            
            Many of my friend’s complaint that their father does not look after them because of their work. Also, they even said that they hate their father because he often comes late and doesn’t love them. Besides, I am lucky that my father is different from them as he gives importance to his family first and after that work.
            
            In addition, he makes sure to come at a time and give time to us (his family). He is a caring husband and helps our mother in small household work to share her workload.
            
            To conclude, my father is a responsible man who clearly knows that between work and family; family comes first. Also, he is always ready to help others no matter what he is doing. Besides, he completely dedicated to his work but does not ignore us in the event. Above all, we stay put to him as we have learned all our good deeds from him.

            True Friendship
            A person is acquainted with many persons in their life. However, the closest ones become our friends. You may have a large friend circle in school or college, but you know you can only count on one or two people with whom you share true friendship.
            
            There are essentially two types of friends, one is good friends the other are true friends or best friends. They’re the ones with whom we have a special bond of love and affection. In other words, having a true friend makes our lives easier and full of happiness.
            Most importantly, true friendship stands for a relationship free of any judgments. In a true friendship, a person can be themselves completely without the fear of being judged. It makes you feel loved and accepted. This kind of freedom is what every human strives to have in their lives.
            
            In short, true friendship is what gives us reason to stay strong in life. Having a loving family and all is okay but you also need true friendship to be completely happy. Some people don’t even have families but they have friends who’re like their family only. Thus, we see having true friends means a lot to everyone.
            Importance of Friendship
            Friendship is important in life because it teaches us a great deal about life. We learn so many lessons from friendship which we won’t find anywhere else. You learn to love someone other than your family. You know how to be yourself in front of friends.
            
            Friendship never leaves us in bad times. You learn how to understand people and trust others. Your real friends will always motivate you and cheer for you. They will take you on the right path and save you from any evil.
            
            Similarly, friendship also teaches you a lot about loyalty. It helps us to become loyal and get loyalty in return. There is no greater feeling in the world than having a friend who is loyal to you.
            
            Moreover, friendship makes us stronger. It tests us and helps us grow. For instance, we see how we fight with our friends yet come back together after setting aside our differences. This is what makes us strong and teaches us patience.
            
            Therefore, there is no doubt that best friends help us in our difficulties and bad times of life. They always try to save us in our dangers as well as offer timely advice. True friends are like the best assets of our life because they share our sorrow, sooth our pain and make us feel happy.
